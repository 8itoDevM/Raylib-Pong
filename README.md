# Pong Clone – My First Game Without a Game Engine

This project is a basic **Pong clone** made entirely in **C++** using the **[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)** library. It's officially my first game built **without using any game engine**, which means everything—from the game loop to the rendering and input handling—was manually coded.

## 🎮 About the Game

A classic Pong-style arcade game where:
- The **player controls the right paddle** using the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys.
- The **CPU controls the left paddle**, which follows the ball's position.
- Points are scored when the ball passes the opponent's side.
- First to score? Infinite mode—you decide when to stop playing.

## 🛠️ Features

- Custom-built game loop using raylib
- CPU paddle with basic AI behavior
- Ball resets and randomizes direction after scoring
- Collision detection between ball and paddles
- Simple and clean rendering
- Scoreboard system

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How a game loop works behind the scenes
- Handling input and collision manually
- Working with graphics via a lightweight C++ library
- Organizing game logic using basic OOP (classes and inheritance)
- Debugging and iterating without the support of an engine
